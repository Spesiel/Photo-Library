# Photo Library
This application aims at being an all-around tool for picture library manipulation.

The pictures can be tagged, gathered in albums, searched through by Exif data...

The point is not to replace photoshop or something but to allow small or time-consuming bash modifications to be done, like changing all of the Exif DateTaken tags from those pics from the 80s to some date in particular, and the Gps tag to be set, etc.

Of course, the ability to rotate pics is available, as does deletion, markup, etc.
